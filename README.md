# make a music
This code uses Windows error sounds to generate music. First, randomly select the ID and length of the Windows error sound, then play around with the selected error sound a bit to change the pitch. Then use the pitch of the played error sound for the melody and the length of that pitch for the rhythm. Repeat this 32 times to generate a song consisting of 8 parts.

Then define the sampling frequency and note length to generate sample sounds with frequencies from 100 Hz to 8000 Hz. Then, use the melody and rhythm of each part to select segments from the sampled sounds and generate a musical composition.

Finally, play the generated music(sounds).
